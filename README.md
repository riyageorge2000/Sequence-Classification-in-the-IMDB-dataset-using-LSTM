# LSTM for Sequence Classification in the IMDB Dataset

This project implements Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for sequence classification on the IMDB dataset. 
The goal is to classify movie reviews as positive or negative based on the provided text.

### Overview

- Utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning implementation.
- IMDB dataset is used for training and testing the LSTM model.
- The model consists of an embedding layer, LSTM layer, and a dense output layer with sigmoid activation.
- Input sequences are truncated and padded to a specified length.

### Prerequisites

- TensorFlow
- Keras
